 [quote]I had the same problem. Then I found in the dmesg log file that "wlan0" was renamed to "wlan1". After changing all "wlan0" entries in the interfaces file to "wlan1" and restarted networking with "service networking restart" it worked instantly. :)[/quote]
        - Need to include in network configurator the dummy network it sometimes make... so that users don't have to do this on their own. :)
