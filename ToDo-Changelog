[b]Bug Fixes[/b]

[/indent]

Enhancements
	- Picuntu does not have telnet !!! must include (almost a BUG !!)
	- Front-end to manager CPU clock freq
        - Issue 28: Front-end to manage several screen resolutions.
          (I had the same problem. Then I found in the dmesg log file that "wlan0" was renamed to "wlan1". After changing all "wlan0" entries in the interfaces file to "wlan1" and restarted networking with "service networking restart" it worked instantly. :) )
        - Need to include in network configurator the dummy network it sometimes make... so that users don't have to do this on their own. :)
        - Droidemote server to be installed at boot time, with xfce - Error - to be fixed
        - wireless-mode ad-hoc - to introduce the ability to do ad-hoc connection -by network configuration.
