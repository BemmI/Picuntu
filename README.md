Welcome to PicUntu development zone.

You would find here files that are updated, on a 'regular basis'. Not nightly :). I will be travelling for a while betwen Feb 6th to Feb 13th, and hence you may not get much updates during this period.

This is in preparation for the release of PicUntu 0.9-RC3.

You can find more information about the project at http://picuntu.g8.net
